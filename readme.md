# Exploratory Data Analysis
### Missing Values Visualisation
![Alt text](/check_missingvalues.png?raw=true "Check_missingvalues")

This is no missing value in the sample data

### Correlation
![Alt text](/correlation.png?raw=true "correlation")

Water height has a positive correlation with cumulative rain, while cumulative rain has a positive correlation with both instantaneous rain and water height.

### Data Distribution
![Alt text](/data_distribution.png?raw=true "data_distribution")

All data are right skewed
